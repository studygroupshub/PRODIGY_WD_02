## 🧠 How It Works

* The stopwatch uses a **single time variable** (in milliseconds) for simplicity.
* Time updates every **10 milliseconds** using `setInterval`.
* Hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds are calculated from the total time.
* Lap times are dynamically added to the list while the stopwatch is running.
